# Bioinformatics-Student-Portfolio
## Hello World!
My name is Destinee Morrow and this repository contains some of my work throughout my time in graduate school at Hood College 2018-2020.

This portfolio is a current work in progress, please bare with me as I work on getting it up to date. 
Most of these files are going to be independently based works. 
Files included are R scripts, R Markdowns, Jupyter Notebooks, SQL, PHP and TXT.

Various classes in which these projects were originated:
1. Knowledge reasoning/Machine Learning
2. Data Visualization for Bioinformatics
3. Intro to Database Systems and SQL
4. Programming 
5. Bioinformatics Applications
6. Data Science 

Happy Coding :)
